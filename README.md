# RandomPokemonGenerator

The name is quite self-explanatory. This program generates pokemon randomly. 
Once a random pokemon has been generated alongside its front sprite and pokedex entry, you can immediately look that pokemon up on Google or
Bulbapedia.

PokeAPI and Custom Tkinter were used to create this program. Built on Python 3.11.3.
